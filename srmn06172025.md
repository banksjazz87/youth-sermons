## II.Interactive Games(25 - 30 minutes)

### Game 1: Word Association Hot Potato

    ** Objective:** To get the boys thinking quickly about words and their connections, and to show how words can rapidly lead to other thoughts / ideas.

** Materials:** A soft ball or beanbag.  
** Setup:** Boys sit in a circle.

** Instructions:**
    - One person starts by saying a word(e.g., "fast").
- They immediately pass the "hot potato"(ball) to the person next to them.
- The next person must say a word that they associate with the previous word(e.g., "fast" → "car").
- They then pass the ball, and the next person says an associated word("car" → "engine").
- The goal is to keep the chain going quickly.If someone hesitates for more than 3 seconds or repeats a word, they are out.The last few players win.

** Discussion(Brief):**
    _"How quickly did words lead to other ideas? What happens when someone says something random or negative? It can break the flow, right?"_

### Game 2: Blindfolded Obstacle Course with Verbal Guidance

    ** Objective:** To demonstrate the critical importance of clear, encouraging, and precise words, and how negative or unclear words can hinder progress and confidence.

** Materials:** Blindfolds(one for each pair or group), various safe obstacles(chairs, cushions, ropes on the floor, cones, etc.).  
** Setup:** Create a simple, safe obstacle course in an open area.Divide boys into pairs or small groups(one blindfolded, one giving directions).

** Instructions:**
    - One partner is blindfolded and cannot see the course.
- The other partner must use only their words to guide their blindfolded partner through the obstacle course without touching them.
- Encourage clear, specific, and positive instructions(e.g., "Take two small steps forward," "Raise your right foot over the cushion," "Turn slightly to your left").

** Discussion:**
    - "What was it like being blindfolded and only relying on words?"
    - "What kind of words helped you the most? (e.g., clear, encouraging, specific)"
    - "What kind of words made it harder? (e.g., confusing, negative, shouting)"
    - "How did it feel when your partner gave good directions? How about bad ones?"
    - "How does this relate to how we use our words with friends or family?"

## III.Sermon: The Power of Your Words(10 - 15 minutes)

### Introduction(Slide 1: Title)

"Hey guys! We just played some games that really showed us how powerful words can be. In 'Hot Potato,' one word led to another, sometimes really fast! In the 'Obstacle Course,' your words literally guided someone, either making them succeed or causing them to stumble."

"Tonight, we're going to talk about something super important: the incredible power of the words you speak. Every single day, you use words – in person, online, in texts. But have you ever stopped to think about the real impact they have?"

---

### Point 1: Words Have Creative and Destructive Power(Slide 2: Genesis 1: 3 & Proverbs 18: 21)

"The Bible tells us that words are incredibly powerful. Right at the very beginning of the Bible, in Genesis 1:3, what do we read?  
'And God said, 'Let there be light, ' and there was light.'  
God spoke, and creation happened! His words brought things into existence.That's creative power!"

"Now, we're not God, but our words also have the power to create – not light, but things like courage, hope, and connection. Or, they can destroy."

"Proverbs 18:21 puts it really clearly:  
'Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and those who love it will eat its fruits.'  
Think about that.Death and life.Our words can bring life – encouragement, laughter, healing, motivation.Or they can bring death – sadness, discouragement, anger, broken relationships.It’s like a superpower we all have!"

---

### Point 2: Words are Like a Spark(Slide 3: James 3: 5 - 6)

"Imagine a tiny spark. What can it do? Not much, right? But if that spark lands in the wrong place, like a dry forest, it can cause a massive, uncontrollable fire. The Bible says our tongue is like that spark."

"In James 3:5-6, it says:  
'How great a forest is set ablaze by such a small fire! And the tongue is a fire, a world of unrighteousness.'  
A few careless or angry words can start a huge argument, hurt someone's feelings deeply, or damage a reputation, and it can be really hard to put that fire out."

"Think about online comments or group chats. A quick, mean comment might seem small, but it can spread like wildfire and cause a lot of pain."

---

### Point 3: Words Come From Your Heart(Slide 4: Matthew 12: 34 - 37)

"So, where do these powerful words come from? From our brains? From our mouths? Jesus tells us in Matthew 12:34:  
'For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.'  
This means that what's inside your heart – your thoughts, your feelings, your attitudes – eventually comes out through your words."

"If your heart is full of anger, jealousy, or negativity, those kinds of words are likely to come out. But if your heart is full of kindness, compassion, and positivity, your words will reflect that."

"And Jesus adds in Matthew 12:36-37:  
'I tell you, on the day of judgment people will give account for every careless word they speak, for by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.'  
This means our words matter so much that God takes them seriously.They reveal what's truly in us."

---

### Point 4: Choose Words That Build Up(Slide 5: Ephesians 4: 29)

"So, knowing all this, how should we use our words? The Apostle Paul gives us clear instructions in Ephesians 4:29:  
'Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is good for building up, as fits the occasion, that it may give grace to those who hear.'"

"'Corrupting talk' means words that are mean, rude, gossipy, complaining, or tearing others down. Instead, we should aim for words that are 'good for building up.' Think of it like being a construction worker with your words. You want to build people up, encourage them, give them confidence, and make them feel good."

"This applies to everything: your friends, your family, your teammates, even people you don't know well. Think before you speak: 'Will this build up or tear down?'"

---

### Conclusion & Call to Action(Slide 6: Challenge)

"Guys, your words are a gift from God, a tool of incredible power. You have the choice every single day to use them for life or for death, to build up or to tear down."

    ** Challenge for this week:**
        - Be intentional about your words.
- Think before you speak.Pause and ask, 'Is this kind? Is this true? Is this necessary? Is this helpful?'
    - Look for opportunities to speak life.Compliment someone, encourage a friend, thank your parents, tell someone they did a good job.
- Apologize quickly if you use your words carelessly.

"Let's be boys who use our words to bring life, to encourage, and to honor God. Because your words truly matter."
